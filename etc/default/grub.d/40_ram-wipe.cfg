## Wiping RAM at shutdown to defeat cold boot attacks.
##
## RAM wipe is enabled by default on host operating systems, real hardware.
## RAM wipe is disabled by default inside virtual machines (VMs).
##
## Most users should not make any modifications to this config file because
## there is no need for that.

## RAM wipe is omitted in virtual machines (VMs) by default because it is
## unclear if that could actually lead to the host operating system using
## swap, which means writing VM RAM contents to the disk which would be counter
## productive.

## By using kernel parameter wiperam=force it is possible to
## force RAM wipe inside VMs which is useful for testing, development purposes.
## There is no additional security benefit setting wiperam=force setting
## on host operating systems because ram-wipe runs by default anyhow
#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT wiperam=force"

## Kernel parameter wiperam=skip is provided to support disabling RAM wipe
## at shutdown, which might be useful to speed up shutdown or in case should
## there ever be issues.
#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT wiperam=skip"
